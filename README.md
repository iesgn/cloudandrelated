# Cloud Computing and related technologies

This course does not focus on a particular technology or a specific
set of them. It tries to provide  an overview of the change taking
place in IT systems and the new way to develop and deploy
applications for high demanding environments. This course is aimed at
those who are starting out in this field and need a general overview
of the technologies used, so it can even be considered as a previous
course to a more specific one about IaaS, PaaS, resource provisioning,
automated configuration or containers.
