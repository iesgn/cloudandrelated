  <h3>Traditional deployment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The applications are traditionally implemented as a single set of libraries and configuration files.</li>
    <li>They are implemented in an operating system (on physical or virtual servers) with a set of services running (web, database, ...).</li>
    <li>Disadvantage 1: O.S. updates can interrupt the application.</li>
    <li>Disadvantage 2: If several applications are running on the same system, the library updates of one of them can affect other applications.</li>
    <li>Possible solution: High availability systems that minimize the downtime of an application.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What alternatives can be used today?</h3>
  <h2>Containers</h2>

  <h2>What are containers?</h2>
  <p>Containers are a type of partition isolated within a single
  operating system. They offer many of the same benefits as virtual
  machines, such as security, storage, and network isolation, but
  require far fewer hardware resources and are quicker to start and
  stop. They also isolate the libraries and runtime environment (such
  as CPU and storage) used by an application to minimize the impact of
  an OS upgrade on the host OS.

<section>
  <h2>Containers benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Environment isolation</li>
    <li>Smaller hardware resources needed</li>
    <li>Quick deployment</li>
    <li>Components reused</li>
    <li>The impact of errors/changes can be minimized</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Containers disadvantage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Complexity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Deployment of Microservice based applications</h2>
  <p>Containers promote the <strong>microservice</strong> based
  application development approach (vs monolithic applications),
  because the different services into which we the application is
    separated can easily run in different containers.</p>
  <p>Advantages: Each container offers a service, they are easier to
  maintain, to scale, to start, to update,...</p>

  <h2>OpenShift</h2>
  <p>Development Platform, with Cloud Computing (PaaS) features
    developed by Red Hat</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We focus on application development</li>
    <li>Openshift uses Docker (CRI-O) and Kubernetes internally</li>
    <li>It allows us to deploy applications in different environments
      (development, production, ...)</li>
    <li>It facilitates continuous integration</li>
    <li>We have several ways to interact with OpenShift: web
      application, CLI or API REST</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Docker</h2>
  <cite>“Build, Ship and Run. Any application, Anywhere”</cite>
  <ul>
    <li>Docker is a lightweight virtualization system that allows us
      to work with application containers.</li>
    <li>The containers are self-sufficient (although they can depend
    on other containers), requiring nothing more than the image of the
      container for the services it offers to work.</li>
    <li>Multiple containers share the same core, but each container
    can be restricted to using only a defined amount of resources such
      as CPU, memory and I/O.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Kubernetes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Kubernetes is an open source system that allows us to
    automatically deploy, scale and manage application
      containers.</li>
    <li>It manages a set of servers where the containers are
      executed.</li>
    <li>The real applications are formed by several containers, K8S
    offers us mechanisms to manage them: implementation, service
    assurance, error tolerance, scalability, continuous updates,
    integration and automatic deployments, load balancing, monitoring,
    ...</li>
  </ul>
