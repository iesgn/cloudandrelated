  <h2>Linux won</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Innovations on almost every IT field are performed using Linux as OS
      and open source software</li>
    <li>Cloud computing is paradigmatic: "Clouds are made of linux
    servers"</li>
    <li>Windows won on desktop computers, but who cares today?</li>
    <li>All the cloud is running on linux servers, but ... in cloud
      computing you don't care about the OS</li>
    <li>Linux won :), but did we win? :(</li>

  <p>It's good to get all the benefits of cloud computing technologies
  to feel comfortable using a linux box from the command line,
  because it's the natural environment to them</p>
