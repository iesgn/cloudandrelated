  <h2>Application evolution</h2>
  <p>The way the application are developed and deployed is changing,
    as well as the applications themselves.</p>
  <p>The typical application some years ago was running locally on a
    PC, however today most of the applications run on a remote web
    server and are used trough a web browser or a mobile app.</p>

  <h2>Scale up vs scale out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Scale up or vertical scaling: Adding more resources to the
      system when needed</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to scale up</li>
      <li>Limited to the resources available to one system</li>
      <li>Difficult to scale down</li>
      <li>The application doesn't need to be adapted</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Scale out or horizontal scaling: Asociated to distributed
      architectures. More nodes are added when needed</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Needs some automation to scale</li>
      <li>Easy to increase or decrease used resources</li>
      <li>The application needs to be adapted (distributed
	architecture)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monolithic application</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All the components executed in the same node</li>
